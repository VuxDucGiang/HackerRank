# [Java Currency Formatter](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-currency-formatter)

Given a double-precision number, `payment`, denoting an amount of money, use the `NumberFormat` class' `getCurrencyInstance` method to convert `payment` into the US, Indian, Chinese, and French currency formats. Then print the formatted values as follows:

```text
US: formattedPayment
India: formattedPayment
China: formattedPayment
France: formattedPayment
```

where `formattedPayment` is `payment` formatted according to the appropriate Locale's currency.

> [!NOTE]
> India does not have a built-in Locale, so you must construct one where the language is `en` (i.e., English).
